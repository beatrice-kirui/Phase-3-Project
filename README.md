 This repository contains code for a machine learning project that analyzes a dataset of SyriaTel Customer Churn. The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset and develop a predictive model to identify factors that contribute to customer churn.By understanding these factors, the company can take proactive measures to reduce churn and improve customer retention. .
